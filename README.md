# NLP for Talpiot

## Installations
The exercises you will be given during this mini-course will be given as Jupyter notebooks, that we recommend implementing on Google Colab. You are highly advised to get yourself acquainted with the keyboard shortcuts, it will make your life much easier.

## Additional Material
1. Stanford's CS231n (CNNs for Visual Recognition) is ***highly recommended***. The [course website](http://cs231n.stanford.edu/) contains lots of useful material, and recorded lectures can be found on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL3FW7Lu3i5JvHM8ljYj-zLfQRF3EO8sYv).
1. Stanford's CS224n (NLP with Deep Learning) is also ***highly recommended***. Useful material can be found on the [course website](http://web.stanford.edu/class/cs224n/), and the lectures can be found on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL3FW7Lu3i5Jsnh1rnUwq_TcylNr7EkRe6).
1. Andrew Ng's [Machine learning course](https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning) on Coursera is good. Also on Coursera, you can find his series of [5 mini-courses in deep learning](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/deep-learning), which is also very good.
